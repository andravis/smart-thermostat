## IBM Watson Skill

I created a "Home Butler" Assistant that accepts user commands such as:
- See if the thermostat is running
- Set a desired temperature
- Turn off the thermostat

To do all of this, the Home Butler leverages an IBM Watson Skill (JSON) found in this repo and invokes webhook calls to leverage an API endpoint.

**Demo this skill at:**

Also, check out my article published on Level Up Coding to see how I built it:
