## IBM Watson Skill

I created a "Home Butler" Assistant that accepts user commands such as:
- See if the thermostat is running
- Set a desired temperature
- Turn off the thermostat

To do all of this, the Home Butler leverages an IBM Watson Skill (JSON) found in this repo and invokes webhook calls to a mock API endpoint.

**Demo this skill at:**

https://assistant-chat-us-south.watsonplatform.net/web/public/cbe2cd31-a742-4a04-a3be-73506933e982

Important: This demo sends data to an unsecure API endpoint. Do not send any real information. It's just for fun and testing purposes.

**Make it your own**
1. Download the JSON file
2. Create an Assistant in IBM Cloud
3. Upload this skill (JSON)
4. Go to Options and change the Webhook URL to your own
5. Test it in the Try it pane or the Preview Link

**Check out my article published on Level Up Coding to see how I built it:**
